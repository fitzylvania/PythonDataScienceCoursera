    "## Merging Dataframes\n",
    "Last week, we were introduced to the pandas data manipulation and analysis library. We saw that there is really two-core data structures which are very similar, the one-dimensional series object and the two-dimensional DataFrame object. Querying these two data structures is done in a few different ways, such as using the iloc or loc attributes for row-based querying, or using the square brackets on the object itself for column-based querying. Most importantly, we saw that one can query the DataFrame and Series objects through Boolean masking. And Boolean masking is a powerful filtering method which allows us to use broadcasting to determine what data should be kept in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's lecture, we're going to go into more detail on how to manipulate DataFrame, in particular. We're going to explore how to reduce and process data using GroupBy and Apply, and how to join data sets from multiple files together into one. We'll also talk about some features that pandas has which are useful for both traditional statistical analyses and machine learning. Let's start with how to merge data sets. We've already seen how we add new data to an existing DataFrame. We simply use the square bracket operator with the new column name, and the data is added as long as an index is shared. If there is no shared index and a scalar value is passed in, which remember a scalar value is just a single value like an integer or a string. The new value column is added with the scalar value as the default value. What if we wanted to assign a different value for every row? Well, it gets trickier. If we could hardcode the values into a list, then pandas will unpack them and assign them to the rows. But if the list we have isn't long enough, then we can't do this, since Pandas doesn't know where the missing values should go."

    "## Pandas Idioms\n",
    "Python programmers will often suggest that there many ways the language can be used to solve a particular problem. But that some are more appropriate than others. The best solutions are celebrated as Idiomatic Python and there are lots of great examples of this on stack overflow and websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "An idiomatic solution is often one which has both high performance and high readability. This isn't necessarily true. A sort of sub-language within Python, Pandas has its own set of idioms. We've alluded to some of these already, such as using vectorization whenever possible, and not using iterative loops if you don't need to. Several developers and users within the Panda's community have used the term pandorable for these idioms. I think it's a great term. So, I wanted to share with you a couple of key features of how you can make your code pandorable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these is called method chaining. Now we saw that previously, you could chain pandas calls together when you're querying DataFrames. For, instance if you wanted to select rows based on index like county name. Then you wanted to only project certain columns like the total population, you can write a query, like df.loc[“Washtenaw”][“Total Population”] This is a form of chaining, called chain indexing. And it's generally a bad practice. Because it's possible that pandas could be returning a copy or a view of the DataFrame depending upon the underlying NumPy library. In his descriptions of idiomatic Pandas patterns developer Tom Osberger described a rule of thumb for this. If you see back to back square brackets, then you should think carefully if you want to be doing chain indexing. I think this is great as a sort of code smell or anti pattern."

    "Method chaining though, little bit different. The general idea behind method chaining is that every method on an object returns a reference to that object.

In this code, there's no in place flag being used and you can see that when we first run a where query, then a dropna, then a set_index, and then a rename. You might wonder why the whole statement is enclosed in parentheses and that's just to make the statement more readable. In Python, if you begin with an open parentheses, you can span a statement over multiple lines and things read a little bit nicer. "

    "### Traditional Coding Approach\n",
    "The second example is a more traditional way of writing code. There's nothing wrong with this code in the functional sense, you might even be able to understand it better as a new person to the language. It's just not as pandorable as the first example. Now, the key with any good idiom is to understand when it isn't helping you. In this case, you can actually time both methods and see that the latter method is faster. So, this is a particular example of a classic time readability trade off."

    "Here's another pandas idiom. Python has a wonderful function called <b>`map`</b>, which is sort of a basis for functional programming in the language. When you want to use <b>`map`</b> in Python, you pass it some function you want called, and some iterable, like a list, that you want the function to be applied to. The results are that the function is called against each item in the list, and there's a resulting list of all of the evaluations of that function.\n",

    "Python has a similar function called applymap. In applymap, you provide some function which should operate on each cell of a DataFrame, and the return set is itself a DataFrame. Now I think applymap is fine, but I actually rarely use it. Instead, I find myself often wanting to map across all of the rows in a DataFrame. And pandas has a function that I use heavily there, called apply. Let's look at an example.\n",

    "Let's take our census DataFrame. In this DataFrame, we have five columns for population estimates. Each column corresponding with one year of estimates. It's quite reasonable to want to create some new columns for minimum or maximum values, and the apply function is an easy way to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to write a function which takes in a particular row of data, finds a minimum and maximum values, and returns a new row of data. We'll call this function min_max, this is pretty straight forward. We can create some small slice of a row by projecting the population columns. Then use the NumPy min and max functions, and create a new series with a label values represent the new values we want to <b>`apply`</b>."

    "Okay, this is all great, and apply is an extremely important tool in your toolkit. But this lecture wasn't really supposed to be about the new features of the API, but about making pandorable code. The reason I introduced <b>`apply`</b> here is because you rarely see it used with large function definitions, like we did. Instead, you typically see it used with <b>`lambdas`</b>. Now, you'll recall from the first week of this course that knowing <b>`lambdas`</b> isn't a requirement of the course. But to get the most of the discussions you'll see online, you're going to need to know how at least read <b>`lambdas`</b>. Here's a one line example of how you might calculate the max of the columns using the apply function. You can imagine how you might chain several apply calls with <b>`lambdas`</b> together to create a readable yet succinct data manipulation script."

Go look at some of the top ranked questions on pandas on Stack Overflow, and look at how some of the more experienced authors, answer those questions. Do you see any interesting patterns?

    "We've seen that even though PANDAS allows us to iterate over every row in a data frame this is generally a slow way to accomplish a given task and it's not very pandorable. For instance, if we wanted to write some code to iterate over all the of the states and generate a list of the average census population numbers. We could do so using a loop in the unique function. Another option is to use the dataframe group by function. This function takes some column name or names and splits the dataframe up into chunks based on those names, it returns a dataframe group by object. Which can be iterated upon, and then returns a tuple where the first item is the group condition, and the second item is the data frame reduced by that grouping. Since it's made up of two values, you can unpack this, and project just the column that you're interested in, to calculate the average.\n",

    "Now, 99% of the time, you'll use group by on one or more columns. But you can actually provide a function to group by as well and use that to segment your data. This is a bit of a fabricated example but lets say that you have a big batch job with lots of processing and you want to work on only a third or so of the states at a given time. We could create some function which returns a number between zero and two based on the first character of the state name. Then we can tell group by to use this function to split up our data frame. It's important to note that in order to do this you need to set the index of the data frame to be the column that you want to group by first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example. We'll create some new function called fun and if the first letter of the parameter is a capital M we'll return a 0. If it's a capital Q we'll return a 1 and otherwise we'll return a 2. Then we'll pass this function to the data frame reply, and see that the data frame is segmented by the calculated group number. This kind of technique, which is sort of a light weight hashing, is commonly used to distribute tasks across multiple workers. Whether they are cores in a processor, nodes in a supercomputer, or disks in a database. A common work flow with group bias that you split your data, you apply some function, then you combine the results. This is called split apply combine pattern. And we've seen the splitting method, but what about apply? Certainly iterative methods as we've seen can do this, but the groupby object also has a method called agg which is short for aggregate. This method applies a function to the column or columns of data in the group, and returns the results."

    "We can do the same thing with a data frame instead of a series. We set the index to be the state name, we group by the index, and we project two columns. The population estimate in 2010, the population estimate in 2011. When we call aggregate with two parameters, it builds a nice hierarchical column space and all of our functions are applied. Where the confusion can come in is when we change the labels of the dictionary we passed to aggregate, to correspond to the labels in our group data frame. In this case, pandas recognizes that they're the same and maps the functions directly to columns instead of creating a hierarchically labeled column. From my perspective this is very odd behavior, not what I would expect given the labeling change. So just be aware of this when using the aggregate function."

    "## Scales\n",
    "Now that we've covered many of the mechanics of Pandas, I want to stop and talk for a moment about data types and scales. We've already seen that Pandas supports a number of different computational data types such as strings, integers and floating point numbers. What this doesn't capture is what we call the scale of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we have a data frame of students and their academic levels such as being in grade 1 or grade 2 and grade 3. There's a difference between a student in grade 1 and a student in grade 2, the same as the difference between a student in grade 8 and a student in grade 9. Well let's think about the final exam scores these students might get on assignments. Is the difference between an A and an A minus the same as the difference between an A minus and a B plus? At the University of Michigan at least, the answer is usually no.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've intuitively seen some different scales, and as we move through data cleaning and statistical analysis and machine learning, it's important to clarify our knowledge and terminology. As a data scientist there four scales that it's worth knowing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ratio Scale\n",
    "The first is a ratio scale. In the ratio scale the measurements units are equally spaced and mathematical operations, such as subtract, division, and multiplication are all valid. Good examples of ratio scale measurements might be the height and weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interval Scale\n",
    "The next scale is the interval scale. In the interval scale the measurement units are equally spaced like the ratio scale. But there's no clear absence of value. That is there isn't a true zero, and so operation such as multiplication and division are not valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the interval scale might be the temperatures measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit. Since there's never an absence of temperature and 0 degrees is a meaningful value of temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The direction on a campus might be another good example where 0 degrees on the campus doesn't indicate a lack of direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the work you do at data mining, the differences between the ratio and interval scales might not be clearly apparent or important than the algorithm you're applying. But it's important to have this clear in your mind when you're applying advanced statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordinal Scale\n",
    "The next scale is the ordinal scale, and this is also important. In the ordinal scale the order of values is important but the differences between the values are not equally spaced. Here is a grading method that is used in many classes at the University of Michigan as a great example, where letter grades are given with pluses and minuses. But when you compare this to percentage values you see that a letter by itself covers 4% of the available grades and that a letter with a plus or minus is usually just 4% for the available grades. Based on this, it would be odd if there were as many students who received an A plus or A minus as there were who received a straight A.\n",
    "Ordinal data is very common in machine learning and can sometimes be a challenge to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nominal Scale\n",
    "The last scale I'll mention is the nominal scale which is often just called categorical data. Here the names of teams in a sport might be good example. There are a limited number of teams but changing their order or playing mathematical function to them is meaningless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical values are very common and we generally refer to categories where there are only two possible values as binary."

  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "So why did I stop talking about Pandas and jump into this discussion of scale. Well, given how important they are in statistics and machine learning, Pandas has a number of interesting functions to deal with converting between measurement scales. Let's start first with nominal data, which in Pandas is called categorical data. Panda is actually has a built in type for categorical data and you could set a column of your data to categorical data by using the as type method. As type tries to change the underlying type of your data, in this case to category data. You can further change this to ordinal data by passing in an ordered flags set to true and passing in the categories in an ordered fashion. Here's an example. Let's create a data frame of letter grades in the descending order. We can also set an index value of some more course grain measure."

    "Variables with a Boolean value are typically called dummy variables. And pandas has a built-in function called get dummies, which will convert the values of a single column into multiple columns of 0's and 1's, indicating the presence of a dummy variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one more function on scales that I'd like to talk about. And that's on reducing a value which is on the interval or ratio scale, like a number grade, into one that is categorical like a letter grade. Now, this might seem a bit counter intuitive to you since you're losing information about the value. But it's useful on a couple of places. First, if you're visualizing the frequencies of categories, and this can be an extremely useful approach and histograms are regularly used with converted interval or racial data. And we'll take a look at histograms in the second course in this specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, if you're using a machine learning classification approach on data, then you need to be using categorical data. So reducing dimensionality is useful there too. panda says a function called cut, which takes in argument which is some real like structure of a column or a data frame or a series. It also takes a number of bins to be used and all bins are kept at equal spacing. Let's go back to our census data for an example. We saw that we could group by state, then aggregate to get a list of the average county size by state. If we further apply cut to this with say 10 bins, we can see that the states listed as categoricals using the average county size. Here we see the states like Alabama and Alaska fall into the same category, while California and the District of Colombia fall into a very different category. Now, cutting is just one way to build categories from your data, and there's many other methods. For instance, cut gives you interval data, where the spacing between each category is equal sized. But sometimes you want to form categories based on frequency. You want the number of items in each bin to be the same, instead of the spacing between bins. It really depends on the shape of your data and what you're planning to do with it. And we'll look at some examples of this in the graphing and charting course for those of you who are enrolled in the specialization. That's it for this module of the course. There's a programming assignment to test your knowledge of this module's content and I'll see you back in the next module as a wrap up where we'll talk more about statistics and set up some basics for comparing results of analysis."

    "A pivot table allows us to pivot out one of these columns into a new column headers and compare it against another column as row indices. For instance, let's say we wanted to compare the makes of electric vehicles versus the years and that we wanted to do this comparison in terms of battery capacity. To do this, we tell pandas we want the values to be kilowatts, the index to be the year and the columns to be the make. Then we specify that the aggregation function, and here we'll use the NumPy mean. Here's the results. We see there are NaN values for vendors who didn't have an entry in a given year like Ford in 2012. And we see that most vendors don't have a change in battery capacity over the years, except for Tesla, as they've introduced several new models."
